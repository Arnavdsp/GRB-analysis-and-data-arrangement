#  GRB Analysis and Data Arrangement

> Machine Learning and data preprocessing tools for **Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB)** analysis, including dimensionality reduction, clustering, light curve denoising, and automated batch data arrangement using Python and Shell scripting.

---

## Overview

Gamma-Ray Bursts are the most energetic explosions in the universe, and their analysis involves complex data processing.  
This repository provides a set of **Python scripts** and **Linux Shell utilities** to:

- Clean and organize GRB datasets in bulk
- Perform dimensionality reduction for better feature visualization
- Apply clustering techniques to categorize bursts
- Denoise light curve data for improved signal clarity
- Plot time series data for analysis and interpretation

By combining **machine learning** with **signal processing**, this toolkit streamlines the workflow for GRB researchers.

##  Features

-  **Batch Data Collection** – Automates CSV collection for multiple GRB datasets
-  **Shell Script Utilities** – Quickly arrange raw GRB data on Linux systems
-  **Machine Learning Techniques** – Dimensionality Reduction & Clustering
-  **Light Curve Denoising** – Reduces noise while preserving burst signal
-  **Time Series Plotting** – Visualizes burst behavior over time
-  **Example Outputs** – Includes plotted and denoised light curves
